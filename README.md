# DIY-NLTK
Do it yourself - NLTK in Python

# Purpose
I would like to take a closer look at NLTK and use it for the following scenarios:
 1. How to create N-Grams
 2. How to find out the language the text is written in
 3. bigrams, stemming and lemmatization
 4. How to build a POS (Part-of-Speech) Tagger
 5. How to identify a gender
 6. ...


The basis for this is the following reading: "[Speech and Language Processing (3rd ed. draft)](https://web.stanford.edu/~jurafsky/slp3/)" von
Dan Jurafsky and James H. Martin.
